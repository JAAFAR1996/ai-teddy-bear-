@serve.deployment(
    name="transcription-service",
    num_replicas=2,
    ray_actor_options={"num_cpus": 1, "memory": 2000 * 1024 * 1024}
)
class TranscriptionService:
    # Distributed Whisper transcription
    # Auto-scaling based on load
    # Memory optimized for ESP32-S3 integration
```

### 🔄 **Parallel Processing Pipeline**
```python
# Concurrent service execution
tasks = [
    self._call_service(AIServiceType.TRANSCRIPTION, "transcribe", audio_data),
    self._call_service(AIServiceType.EMOTION_ANALYSIS, "analyze_emotion", audio_data),
    self._call_service(AIServiceType.SAFETY_CHECK, "check_safety", text)
]

# Execute all services in parallel
results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
# Total processing time: sum of slowest service, not sum of all services
```

### 🤖 **Multi-Service AI Architecture**
```python
# Individual specialized services
services = {
    AIServiceType.TRANSCRIPTION: TranscriptionService,     # Whisper + OpenAI
    AIServiceType.EMOTION_ANALYSIS: EmotionAnalysisService, # Multi-modal emotion

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Basic Distributed Processing
```python
from core.infrastructure.ai import DistributedAIProcessor, ChildContext

# Initialize distributed processor
processor = DistributedAIProcessor()
await processor.initialize()

# Create child context
child_context = ChildContext(
    child_id="child_001",
    name="أحمد", 
    age=7,
    language="ar",
    voice_profile="playful"
)

# Process conversation with parallel AI services
audio_data = load_audio_data()  # Audio bytes
response = await processor.process_conversation(audio_data, child_context)

print(f"Transcription: {response.transcription}")
print(f"Emotion: {response.emotion}")
print(f"AI Response: {response.ai_text}")
print(f"Processing Time: {response.processing_time_ms}ms")
```

### Batch Processing
```python
# Process multiple conversations in parallel
conversations = [
    (audio_data_1, child_context_1),
    (audio_data_2, child_context_2),
    (audio_data_3, child_context_3)
]

# Parallel batch processing
responses = await processor.process_batch_conversations(conversations)

# All conversations processed concurrently
for response in responses:
    print(f"Child: {response.service_results['transcription']['text']}")
    print(f"Response: {response.ai_text}")
```

### Performance Monitoring
```python
# Get real-time performance metrics
metrics = processor.get_performance_metrics()

print(f"Total Requests: {metrics['processing_metrics']['total_requests']}")
print(f"Average Time: {metrics['processing_metrics']['average_processing_time_ms']}ms")
print(f"Throughput: {metrics['processing_metrics']['throughput_per_second']} req/s")
print(f"Success Rate: {metrics['processing_metrics']['successful_requests']/metrics['processing_metrics']['total_requests']*100:.1f}%")

# Service health monitoring
for service, status in metrics['service_health'].items():
    print(f"{service}: {status}")
```

### Load Optimization
```python
# Optimize for expected load
await processor.optimize_for_load(expected_load=100)

# Auto-scaling based on queue depth
# Ray Serve automatically provisions workers
# Performance scales linearly with worker count
```
