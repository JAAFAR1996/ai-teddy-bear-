### Child Management Rules
1. **Age Validation**: Children must be 3-12 years old
2. **Profile Consistency**: Voice profiles must match child's age
3. **Safety Override**: Parents can override any child setting
4. **Unique Identity**: Each child linked to unique device UDID

### Conversation Rules  
1. **Single Active Conversation**: Max 1 active conversation per child
2. **Time Limits**: Session and daily limits strictly enforced
3. **Safety Monitoring**: Real-time content filtering and violation tracking
4. **Automatic Escalation**: Human oversight for concerning patterns

### Safety Rules
1. **Age-Appropriate Content**: Dynamic filtering based on age and development
2. **Time Restrictions**: Quiet hours, bedtime, and usage limits
3. **Emotional Monitoring**: Automatic adjustments for emotional state
4. **Parent Notifications**: Real-time alerts for safety concerns

## 🚀 Advanced Domain Features

### Intelligent Conversation Compatibility
```python
# Example: Multi-factor compatibility assessment
compatibility = child_service.assess_conversation_compatibility(
    child=child,
    proposed_topic="dinosaurs", 
    conversation_history=recent_conversations
)
# Returns: compatibility score, recommendations, blocking issues
```

### Comprehensive Safety Assessment
```python
# Example: Full safety evaluation
safety_result = child_service.conduct_comprehensive_safety_assessment(
    child=child,
    recent_conversations=conversations,
    parent_feedback=feedback
)
# Returns: risk factors, protective factors, recommendations
