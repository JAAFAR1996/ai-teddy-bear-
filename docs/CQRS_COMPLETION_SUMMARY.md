## 🏗️ CQRS Architecture

### Write Side (Commands)
```
Client → Command → CommandBus → Validation → Handler → Domain → Events
```

### Read Side (Queries)
```
Client → Query → QueryBus → Cache → Handler → Read Model → Response
```

### Event Projections
```
Domain Events → Projection Manager → Read Models → Query Optimization
```

## ⚡ Performance Features

### Command Side
- **Async processing** with middleware pipeline
- **Event Sourcing integration** for persistence
- **Comprehensive validation** and error handling
- **Performance monitoring** with timing

### Query Side
- **Read model caching** (15min-2hour TTL)
- **Materialized views** for fast queries
- **Pagination support** for large datasets
- **Smart cache invalidation**

### Read Models
- **Denormalized data** optimized for queries
- **Computed fields** (conversation_count, safety_score, engagement_level)
- **Event-driven updates** from domain events
- **Search capabilities** with multiple criteria

## 🔒 Enterprise Features

### Code Quality
- ✅ All functions under 30 lines (requirement: max 40)
