# Architecture Decision Record: Clean Architecture Implementation

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The current system needs to be transformed into an enterprise-grade application. The existing codebase, while functional, lacks clear separation of concerns and proper layering.

## Decision
We will implement Clean Architecture with the following layers:

1. Presentation Layer (Interface Adapters)
   - API Controllers
   - CLI Interface
   - Voice Interface Adapters

2. Application Layer (Use Cases)
   - Conversation Service
   - Child Profile Service
   - Audio Processing Service
   - AI Integration Service

3. Domain Layer (Business Rules)
   - Entities (Child, Conversation, AudioRecord)
   - Value Objects
   - Domain Services
   - Repository Interfaces

4. Infrastructure Layer
   - Database Implementations
   - External Services (OpenAI, Azure Speech)
   - File System Operations
   - Logging & Monitoring

## Consequences
### Positive
- Clear separation of concerns
- Improved testability
- Better maintainability
- Easier to extend functionality
- Domain logic isolation

### Negative
- Initial development overhead
- More complex folder structure
- Learning curve for new developers
