# ADR 003: Audio Module Architecture Design

## Context
The project requires a robust, flexible, and high-performance audio processing system that can handle various audio-related tasks such as recording, playback, processing, and text-to-speech conversion.

## Decision Drivers
- Modularity and extensibility
- Performance and low-latency processing
- Comprehensive error handling
- Separation of concerns
- Testability
- Flexibility for different use cases

## Architectural Approach: Clean Layered Architecture

### Layers
1. **Presentation Layer** (`audio_manager.py`)
   - High-level, user-facing interface
   - Coordinates between different audio components
   - Provides simplified API for audio operations

2. **Business Logic Layer**
   - `audio_recorder.py`: Handles audio recording
   - `audio_processing.py`: Signal processing and audio enhancement
   - `tts_playback.py`: Text-to-speech conversion
   - `state_manager.py`: System state tracking and event management

3. **Data Layer** (`audio_io.py`)
   - Manages audio file I/O operations
   - Handles temporary file management
   - Supports various audio file formats

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. State Management
- Implemented a centralized `StateManager`
- Uses observer pattern for state change notifications
- Supports multiple state-related events
- Provides thread-safe state tracking

#### Rationale
- Enables complex audio workflow management
- Allows decoupled components to react to system state changes
- Provides comprehensive system state visibility

### 2. Dependency Injection
- Components are loosely coupled
- Dependencies are injected via constructor
- Facilitates easier testing and component replacement

#### Rationale
- Improves modularity
- Enables easier mocking in tests
- Supports future extensibility

### 3. Error Handling
- Comprehensive error logging
- Graceful failure modes
- State-based error tracking
- Centralized error management

#### Rationale
- Prevents system crashes
- Provides detailed diagnostic information
- Enables proactive error recovery
- Supports debugging and monitoring

### 4. Concurrency and Performance
- Utilizes threading for non-blocking audio operations
- Implements efficient audio processing algorithms
- Uses NumPy for high-performance numerical computations
- Minimal memory overhead

#### Rationale
- Ensures responsive user experience
- Supports real-time audio processing
- Efficient resource utilization
- Scalable architecture

### 5. Privacy and Security
- Implements secure temporary file management
- Validates and sanitizes audio inputs
- Supports device permission checks
- Minimal data retention

#### Rationale
- Protects user privacy
- Prevents potential security vulnerabilities
- Complies with data protection regulations
- Builds trust in the audio system

### 6. Extensibility
- Modular component design
- Clear interfaces between components
- Support for plugin-like audio processing
- Configurable audio parameters

#### Rationale
- Allows future feature additions
- Supports diverse audio processing requirements
- Enables customization without major refactoring

## Constraints and Considerations
- Requires Python 3.8+
- Depends on external libraries (NumPy, SoundDevice)
- Performance varies with system hardware
- Limited by audio device capabilities

## Alternative Considered
1. Monolithic Architecture
   - Rejected due to reduced flexibility
   - Limited testability
   - Harder to maintain

2. Microservices Architecture
   - Overkill for current requirements
   - Unnecessary complexity
   - Higher resource overhead

## Conclusion
The proposed clean layered architecture provides an optimal balance between performance, modularity, and extensibility for the audio processing system.
