# Architecture Decision Record: Security Implementation

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The application handles children's data and requires robust security measures to ensure COPPA/GDPR compliance and overall data protection.

## Decision
We will implement a comprehensive security architecture:

1. Authentication & Authorization
   - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
   - Parent/Guardian approval system
   - Session management

2. Data Protection
   - Encryption at rest using AES-256
   - TLS 1.3 for data in transit
   - Secure key management

3. Privacy Controls
   - Data minimization
   - Consent management
   - Data retention policies
   - Right to erasure implementation

4. Audit & Compliance
   - Comprehensive audit logging
   - Regular security scanning
   - Automated compliance checks

## Implementation Details

### Encryption Strategy
- Database encryption using SQLCipher
- File system encryption for audio files
- Secure key rotation

### Access Control Matrix
| Role          | Conversations | Profile | Settings | Admin |
|---------------|--------------|---------|----------|-------|
| Child         | Read/Create  | Read    | None     | None  |
| Parent        | Read        | Read/Write| Write   | None  |
| Administrator | Read        | Read     | Write    | Full  |

### Data Retention
- Conversation history: 30 days
- Profile data: Until account deletion
- Audio recordings: 24 hours
- Audit logs: 1 year

### Compliance Measures
1. COPPA Compliance
   - Age verification
   - Parental consent
   - Limited data collection
   - Secure storage

2. GDPR Compliance
   - Right to access
   - Right to be forgotten
   - Data portability
   - Privacy by design

## Consequences
### Positive
- Enhanced data protection
- Regulatory compliance
- Clear security boundaries
- Auditable system

### Negative
- Performance overhead
- Implementation complexity
- Additional maintenance
