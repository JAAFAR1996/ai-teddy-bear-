"""
AI Teddy Bear Continuous Learning System

This module provides enterprise-grade continuous learning capabilities for the
AI Teddy Bear platform, enabling automatic model improvement based on real-world
feedback and performance data.

Key Components:
- ContinuousLearningSystem: Main orchestrator for the learning pipeline
- FeedbackCollector: Collects and processes user feedback and interaction data
- ModelEvaluator: Evaluates current model performance and identifies improvement areas
- TrainingPipeline: Manages automated model training and enhancement
- DeploymentManager: Handles safe model deployment with A/B testing
- PerformanceMonitor: Real-time monitoring and alerting for deployed models

Features:
- Automated feedback collection from multiple sources
- Intelligent model performance evaluation
- Safe and gradual model deployment strategies
- Real-time performance monitoring and alerting
- Comprehensive A/B testing capabilities
- Child safety-first approach with COPPA compliance
- Enterprise scalability and reliability

Usage:
    from src.ml.continuous_learning import ContinuousLearningSystem

    # Initialize the continuous learning system
    learning_system = ContinuousLearningSystem()

    # Start continuous learning
    await learning_system.start_continuous_learning()
