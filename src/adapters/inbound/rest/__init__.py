"""
üåê REST API Adapters - AI Teddy Bear
===================================

Inbound adapters for REST API endpoints.
These adapters translate HTTP requests into application use cases
and format responses back to HTTP.

Following Hexagonal Architecture:
- Adapters depend on ports, not vice versa
- Handle HTTP-specific concerns (status codes, headers, etc.)
- Validate and transform input/output
- Delegate business logic to use cases
